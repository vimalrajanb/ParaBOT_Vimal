Vimal's ParaBOT - Blog Generator

I have created a simple article generation tool using Streamlit and HuggingFace LLMs via the langchain and HuggingFaceEndpoint modules. The app generates a blog based on user inputs, such as the topic, word count, and writing style, using the Mistral-7B model.

This BOT has the following Features:
Generate Blogs: Automatically generates blog content based on the provided topic, word limit, and audience (Researchers, Data Scientists, or Common People).
Responsive UI: The app features a clean and responsive UI with custom styles and a background image.
Customizable: You can modify the app to fit your needs, including changing the blog styles, topics, or the AI model used for content generation.

Happy Coding!
